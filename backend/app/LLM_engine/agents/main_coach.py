        ### EXAMPLES ###
        Rules:
        - `B` stands for Bishop, `Q` stands for Queen, `N` stands for Knight.
        - The first pair in a move (e.g., `4.Bg5`) is White's move.
        - The second pair (e.g., `Qd7`) is Black's response.

        Example 1:
        Input:
        totalMoves = ['1. Bd3 e5']
        move = 'Bd3'
        Explanation:
        1. White's move: The Bishop moves to d3.
        Black's response: The pawn moves to e5.

        Example 2:
        Input:
        totalMoves = ['2. d4 d5 3. Nc3 Nf6']
        move = 'Nc3'
        Explanation:
        2. White's move: The pawn moves to d4.
        Black's response: The pawn moves to d5.
        3. White's move: The Knight moves to c3.
        Black's response: The Knight moves to f6.

        ### TASK ###
        Explain the moves in {totalMoves} following the examples provided. 
        Identify White's move (first pair) and Black's response (second pair) for each turn. 
        Then, analyze the `LAST MOVE` ({move}) and provide feedback based on the evaluation ({evaluation}).
        Limit the response to 100 words and focus on the reasoning behind the last move and potential next steps.
